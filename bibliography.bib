All data was reviewed and validated by industry experts and leading pet retailers and manufacturers.   2021-2022 APPA National Pet Owners Survey Statistics: Pet Ownership \& Annual Expenses   According to the 2021-2022 APPA National Pet Owners Survey, 70\% of U.S. households own a pet, which equates to 90.5 millions homes. In 1988, the first year the survey was conducted, 56\% of U.S. households owned a pet. Breakdown of pet ownership in the U.S. according to the 2021-2022 APPA National Pet Owners Survey Number of U.S. Households that Own a Pet (millions) Bird 	9.9 Cat 	45.3 Dog 	69.0 Horse 	3.5 Freshwater Fish 	11.8 Saltwater Fish 	2.9 Reptile 	5.7 Small Animal 	6.2   Pet Ownership by Generation (\% of Current Pet Owners) Gen Z 	14\% Millennial 	32\% Gen X 	24\% Baby Boomer 	27\% Builder 	3\%   Average Amount Spent on Common Pet Categories in the Past 12 Months  The incredible variety of pet care categories makes it difficult to compare amounts spent across different pet species. The list below is included to give the reader an idea of the types of categories included in the Survey but is not exhaustive of all the expenses captured in the individual pet species report sections.   It reports an approximate dollar amount based on consumer recollection of their spending in the prior 12 months. As such, the dollar amounts should not be added to report total spending in the prior 12 months. According to the 2021-2022 APPA National Pet Owners Survey, some of the basic annual expenses for dog and cat owners in dollars include:                                                        Dogs     Cats     Surgical Vet Visits                   \$458     \$201 Routine Vet                               \$242     \$178       Food                                             \$287     \$254        Food Treats                                \$81       \$72 Kennel Boarding                      \$228     \$78  Vitamins                                      \$81       \$47 Grooming aids/brushes         \$47       \$31 Toys                                               \$56      \$41   **Note: APPA does not ask Survey Participants how much in total they spend on their dog or cats annually.

  abstract = {Replication is central to scientific progress. Because of widely reported replication failures, replication has received increased attention in psychology, sociology, education, management, and related fields in recent years. Replication studies have generally been assessed dichotomously, designated either a ``success'' or ``failure'' based entirely on the outcome of a null hypothesis significance test (i.e., pp {$>$} .05, respectively). However, alternative definitions of success depend on researchers' goals for the replication. Previous work on alternative definitions for success has focused on the analysis phase of replication. However, the design of the replication is also important, as emphasized with the adage, ``an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.'' One critical component of design often ignored or oversimplified in replication studies is sample size planning, indeed, the details here are crucial. Sample size planning for replication studies should correspond to the method by which success will be evaluated. Researchers have received little guidance, some of which is misguided, on sample size planning for replication goals other than the aforementioned dichotomous null hypothesis significance testing approach. In this article, we describe four different replication goals. Then, we formalize sample size planning methods for each of the four goals. This article aims to provide clarity on the procedures for sample size planning for each goal, with examples and syntax provided to show how each procedure can be used in practice.

  abstract = {Normed and nonnormed fit indexes are frequently used as adjuncts to chi-square statistics for evaluating the fit of a structural model. A drawback of existing indexes is that they estimate no known population parameters. A new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of 2 nested models. Two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFIN) and nonnormed (FIN) fit indexes. CFIN avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for P. M. Bentler and D. G. Bonett's (see record 1981-06898-001) normed fit index (NFIN). FIN is a linear function of Bentler and Bonett's nonnormed fit index (NNFIN) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in NNFIN. Asymptotically, CFIN, FIN, NFIN, and a new index developed by K. A. Bollen (1989) are equivalent measures of comparative fit, whereas NNFIN measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. All of the indexes are generalized to permit use of Wald and Lagrange multiplier statistics. An example illustrates the behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct specification and misspecification. The new fit indexes perform very well at all sample sizes.

Large-sample theory provides a chi-square goodness-of-fit test for comparing a model (M) against a general alternative M based on correlated variables. It is suggested that this comparison is insufficient for M evaluation. A general null M based on modified independence among variables is proposed as an additional reference point for the statistical and scientific evaluation of CSMs. Use of the null M in the context of a procedure that sequentially evaluates the statistical necessity of various sets of parameters places statistical methods in covariance structure analysis into a more complete framework. The concepts of ideal Ms and pseudo chi-square tests are introduced, and their roles in hypothesis testing are developed. The importance of supplementing statistical evaluation with incremental fit indices associated with the comparison of hierarchical Ms is also emphasized. Normed and nonnormed fit indices are developed and illustrated. (43 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The understanding of positive development across adolescence rests on having a valid and equivalent measure of this construct across the breadth of this period of life. Does the Positive Youth Development (PYD) construct based on the Five Cs model have satisfactory psychometric properties for such longitudinal measurement invariance? Using longitudinal data derived from the 4-H Study of PYD, we assessed 920 youth (61.6\% female) from a racially and ethically diverse sample (67.3\% European American) who participated in three waves (Grades 8--10) of data collection. Building on prior findings that the Five Cs (i.e., Competence, Confidence, Connection, Character, and Caring) model of PYD was a robust measure that could be assessed comparably during early adolescence, we tested a hierarchy of second-order confirmatory factor analysis models to assess the extent to which PYD can be measured equivalently across middle adolescence. Evidence was found for strict measurement invariance across three measurement occasions, including equivalence of first-order and second-order factor loadings, equality of intercepts of observed variables, and equality of item uniqueness and disturbances of the first-order factors. These results suggest that PYD can be measured in the same way across measurement occasions, a prerequisite for the study of development. Implications for research and application of being able to measure PYD equivalently across adolescence are discussed.},

The author makes the case that the approach grew out of dissatisfaction with a predominant view that underestimated the true capacities of young people by focusing on their deficits rather than their developmental potentials. The article examines three areas of research that have been transformed by the positive youth approach: the nature of the child; the interaction between the child and the community; and moral growth. It concludes with the point that positive youth development does not simply mean an examination of anything that appears to be beneficial for young people. Rather, it is an approach with strong defining assumptions about what is important to look at if we are to accurately capture the full potential of all young people to learn and thrive in the diverse settings where they live.},

In this study, 7 years' worth of enrollment data from 27 Northern California counties was evaluated with linear modeling techniques to determine the impact of market-animal projects (beef, sheep and swine) on program participation. The analysis demonstrated that market-animal projects produce significant, positive effects on enrollment. Each beef project contributed nearly four new members to county enrollment; a single sheep project yielded just over two new members; and two new swine projects produced a single new enrollment. Region and population density influenced membership but year within the study period did not. These results demonstrate the multiplicative effect of beef and sheep projects on county 4-H enrollment.},

Social functioning also was assessed with peer evaluations and children's enacted puppet behavior, and negative arousability-personal distress was assessed with physiological responses. In general, sympathy was associated with relatively high levels of regulation, teacher-reported positive emotionality and general emotional intensity, and especially for boys, high social functioning and low levels of negative emotionality, including physiological reactivity to a distress stimulus. Vagal tone was positively related to boys' self-reported sympathy, whereas the pattern was reversed for girls. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {It is common to summarize statistical comparisons by declarations of statistical significance or nonsignificance. Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary---for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1\% significance level to 4.9\%, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities. The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems---that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ``significant'' and ``not significant'' is not itself statistically significant.},

Value statements along with specific content skills were measured in the survey.

  abstract = {Since the early 1900s, livestock shows have been held throughout the United States for adults and youth to compare the quality of their animals. These shows have been held at the local, county, district, state, regional, and national level. In the early days, one of the most famous shows was the ``International'' held at the stockyards in Chicago, IL. Exhibiting a champion animal at the International was considered the pinnacle of achievements in the livestock industry. The former Dr. O'Dell G. Daniel said, ``There will be livestock shows as long as there are youngsters who have parents and grandparents. Let's not confuse the issue by saying we have steer shows, barrow shows, lambs shows, etc. We have kid shows where it is necessary to have an animal to be admitted through the gate'' (Daniel, 1986). For youth exhibitors, the ``rewards'' for raising and showing animals are more than monetary awards. The former Dr. O'Dell G. Daniel said, ``Junior Livestock Projects are educational. They are the greatest teaching project known to man'' (Daniel, 1986)! If you ask youth what they gain from raising and showing animals, they will respond with a laundry list of what are now referred to as ``life skills'' (Hendricks, 1998). The Targeting Life Skills wheel was developed by P.A. Hendricks at Iowa State University and published in 1998. Working from the Head, Heart, Hands, and Health included in the 4-H motto, Hendricks listed 35 life skills on the ``Targeting Life Skills'' wheel (Figure 1). Many of these ``life skills'' can be attributed to the virtues of raising and showing livestock projects. Regardless of whether the youth is a member of 4-H, FFA or simply raising animals on their family's farm or ranch, the valuable skills developed from raising animal projects are numerous.},

Often, the first study showed a statistically significant result but the replication does not. Questions then arise about whether the first study results were false positives, and whether the replication study correctly indicates that there is truly no effect after all. This article suggests these so-called failures to replicate may not be failures at all, but rather are the result of low statistical power in single replication studies, and the result of failure to appreciate the need for multiple replications in order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and meta-analysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology's alleged crisis, the large sample sizes typically needed to provide firm evidence will almost always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it remains to be seen how many of the recently claimed failures to replicate will be supported or instead may turn out to be artifacts of inadequate sample sizes and single study replications.

This article argues for a biocentric approach to development, in which children's contacts with the non-human world\&mdash;animals, plants, and natural ecologies\&mdash;come under scientific scrutiny. To understand the developmental significance of this ubiquitous aspect of children's environments, theory and research on companion animals in relation to perceptual, cognitive, social, and emotional development are reviewed and evaluated. The significance of children's encounters with animals, especially in the context of a human-companion animal bond, is emphasized. Biocentric research directions are described.},

Building on Grade 5 findings, that ``Five Cs'' (Competence, Confidence, Connection, Character, and Caring) could be empirically defined as latent constructs converging on a second-order construct, labeled PYD, we used structural models to assess the fit of this original model for Grades 5, 6, and 7. Results indicated that PYD continued to be a robust construct that can be defined comparably for Grades 6 and 7, as it was in Grade 5. We discuss implications for future research and for applications of the finding that, across the three years of early adolescence that we assessed (about ages 10 to 12), there is continuity in the structure of PYD.},

The items of the scale are symptoms associated with depression which have been used in previously validated longer scales. The new scale was tested in household interview surveys and in psychiatric settings. It was found to have very high internal consistency and adequate test- retest repeatability. Validity was established by pat terns of correlations with other self-report measures, by correlations with clinical ratings of depression, and by relationships with other variables which support its construct validity. Reliability, validity, and factor structure were similar across a wide variety of demographic characteristics in the general population samples tested. The scale should be a useful tool for epidemiologic studies of de pression.},

A questionnaire was mailed to a sample of 420 4-H beef, sheep, and swine members, with a response rate of 41.9\%. Members were able to accomplish project skills in the areas of sportsmanship, safety, animal grooming, and animal selection. Respondents are not as confident in their abilities related to animal health care. Members who exhibited at the state fair have higher skill levels in the areas of animal health care, animal grooming and animal selection, than 4-H members who exhibited only at the county fair. Members use the responsibility skills they developed from raising 4-H animal projects to complete homework assignments, be on time at work, and care for younger siblings. These skills are benefiting youth in school, at home, and on the job to be more dependable, confident, and qualified individuals.},

This paper reports the results of a systematic literature review focusing on measures of HAI created in the ten-year period since previous reviews ended (2008). Thirty new HAI questionnaires were identified using two sets of search terms. Results indicated that reliability and validity testing were still not standard within tool creation. Companion animal HAI remained dominant in the instrument field; however, there was continued research into exotic animal HAI and the initiation of research into therapy and assistance animal HAI. Refinement of terminology and consistent use of definitions could facilitate researchers from various disciplines being able to locate relevant research in future. Similar review updates are recommended for attitudes to animal tools.},

  abstract = {Survey and longitudinal studies in the social and behavioral sciences generally contain missing data. Mean and covariance structure models play an important role in analyzing such data. Two promising methods for dealing with missing data are a direct maximum-likelihood and a two-stage approach based on the unstructured mean and covariance estimates obtained by the EM-algorithm. Typical assumptions under these two methods are ignorable nonresponse and normality of data. However, data sets in social and behavioral sciences are seldom normal, and experience with these procedures indicates that normal theory based methods for nonnormal data very often lead to incorrect model evaluations. By dropping the normal distribution assumption, we develop more accurate procedures for model inference. Based on the theory of generalized estimating equations, a way to obtain consistent standard errors of the two-stage estimates is given. The asymptotic efficiencies of different estimators are compared under various assumptions. We also propose a minimum chi-square approach and show that the estimator obtained by this approach is asymptotically at least as efficient as the two likelihood-based estimators for either normal or nonnormal data. The major contribution of this paper is that for each estimator, we give a test statistic whose asymptotic distribution is chisquare as long as the underlying sampling distribution enjoys finite fourth-order moments. We also give a characterization for each of the two likelihood ratio test statistics when the underlying distribution is nonnormal. Modifications to the likelihood ratio statistics are also given. Our working assumption is that the missing data mechanism is missing completely at random. Examples and Monte Carlo studies indicate that, for commonly encountered nonnormal distributions, the procedures developed in this paper are quite reliable even for samples with missing data that are missing at random.},
